## OMD Top Thruk Plugin

This plugin saves top data every minute and renders nice graphs to drill down
performance problems on your monitoring host.

## Installation

Assuming you are using OMD (link:https://omd.consol.de[omd.consol.de]).

This is a core plugin, so it is shipped with Thruk and can simply
be enabled by running: `thruk plugins enable omd` or
from the plugins section in the config tool.

It worked if you have a new menu item under `System` -> `OMD Top`.

### Configuration

In order to put processes into groups, you can define those groups in ex.:

`~/etc/thruk/thruk_local.d/omd_top.conf

or

`~/etc/thruk/thruk_local.conf`

For example:

    omd_top = squid                   = squid
    omd_top = /sbin/httpd2            = apache2
    omd_top = /usr/sbin/mysqld        = mysql
    omd_top = /bin/mod_gearman_worker = mod-gearman

You shouldn't define more than 10 groups, otherwise they won't fit onto
the resulting graph. You have to reload the apache to activate changes.

## Usage

The cronjob will collect top data for the last 3 days. On the start page you can
select a time range you want to examine in detail.

On the second page, you can select datapoints to fetch the detailed top data
which then can be sorted by clicking on the table header.

## Extending by own Parsers

The default parser uses linux top data as input source, but it is possible to
write own parser. Just add a new input source to your `thruk_local.conf`:

    omd_top_extra_dir = WinCPU=var/cputop

Then implement ex.: a OMD/Top/Parser/WinCPU.pm based on the existing LinuxTop.pm.
